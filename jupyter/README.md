# MVP 1 - Jupyter Notebook

Props

- interactive, easy to use
- support markdown, shell, python in one notebook
- can record the output (logs)
- can be version controlled

Cons

- weak structure, like step1.1, step1.1.1
- no rollback, need to create another cell/notebook for rollback
- no status, must be careful to manage the steps and when to execute the next step

## Conclusion

half-manual, half-automatic

or, need to build a set of extra rules (file structure, execution plan)
