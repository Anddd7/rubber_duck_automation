# MVP 1 - Logseq (markdown)

Props

- bi-directional linking, can refer the previous expirence easily
- can use page template to standardize the runbook structure
- can use todo, journey to track the status

Cons

- no code execution
- no output log
- rely on the developer to execute the steps in another terminal

## Conclusion

No much difference from the plain markdown file, except the bi-directional linking.
